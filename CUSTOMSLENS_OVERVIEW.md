## Streamlining Customs Clearance in the Netherlands

CustomsLens is a technology platform that completely transforms how customs clearance is handled in the Netherlands. By combining innovative software solutions with strategic partnerships, we help brokers, freight forwarders, and importers navigate Dutch customs with unprecedented speed, compliance, and efficiency.

## The Challenge

The Netherlands, home to Rotterdam - one of Europe's largest ports - processes millions of shipments annually. Yet customs clearance remains stuck in the past:

- **Manual processes** dominate the industry, with critical documents exchanged via email
- **No centralized oversight** of customs requests leads to delays and confusion
- **Compliance errors** cause costly rejections and re-submissions
- **Communication gaps** between forwarders, brokers, and importers create bottlenecks
- **Time-consuming validation** of company information slows down operations

For international forwarders, especially those managing hundreds of importers, these inefficiencies compound into significant operational challenges.

## Our Solution

CustomsLens offers a comprehensive platform that digitizes and automates the entire customs clearance process through two core offerings:

### 1. CustomsLens SaaS Platform

Our web-based software provides two powerful modules that can be used independently or together:

#### DV/BFV Module
**Problem Solved:** Manual processing of Direct Representation (DV) and Limited Fiscal Representation (BFV) documents

Traditional Process:
- Broker emails documents to traders
- Importers fill forms by hand, scan, and return
- Manual validation reveals errors (incorrect VAT, EORI numbers)
- Process restarts from beginning

CustomsLens Process:
- Brokers upload DV/BFV templates with drag-and-drop field placement
- Importers receive secure invitation links
- Real-time API validation of all company information
- Digital signing only after successful validation
- Complete audit trail and compliance documentation

**Key Benefits:**
- 80% reduction in document processing time
- Zero errors from invalid company information
- Full digital archive for compliance
- Automated validation of VAT, EORI, and company registration numbers

#### Customs Requests Module
**Problem Solved:** Email-based customs clearance requests with no visibility or structure

Traditional Process:
- Forwarders send clearance requests via email
- No central repository for documents
- Lost attachments and missing information
- Manual data entry from commercial invoices

CustomsLens Process:
- Structured digital requests with all required fields
- AI-powered extraction from commercial invoices (all languages supported)
- Automatic identification of importers, HS codes, and line items
- Central dashboard showing all active requests
- Document management for T1, CMR, and clearance certificates

**Key Features:**
- Container and truck tracking
- MRN number management
- Multi-modal support (air, sea, rail)
- Real-time status updates
- Complete document trail

### 2. Customs-as-a-Service (CaaS)

For international companies without Dutch customs expertise, we offer a complete managed service:

- **Broker Network Access:** Connection to vetted, high-performing Dutch customs brokers
- **Platform Integration:** Full access to our SaaS platform for transparency
- **Managed Compliance:** We ensure all declarations meet Dutch requirements
- **Single Point of Contact:** One relationship for all Netherlands customs needs

This service is ideal for:
